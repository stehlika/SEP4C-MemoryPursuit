The projects goal was to create a mobile/tablet game in unity that improves the memorization capabilities of the player.

## Getting Started

The projects goal was to create a mobile/tablet game in unity that improves the memorization capabilities of the player. Game combines challenge and entertainment to ensure the desired result. The main emphasis was put on a simple design and implementation to ensure time efficiency and maximize time/learn ratio.
Chosen approach results in a game where the user is asked to remember a sequence of data for a short time frame, while being disturbed and distracted by the series of exercises, therefore short-term memory improvement will be delivered. Gameplay can take as little as few minutes, but can be repeated for hours, with very limited amount of repetition that can further be expanded, satisfactory environment and variety of challenges along the journey
